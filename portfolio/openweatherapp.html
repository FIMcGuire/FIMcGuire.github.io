          <p>
            OpenWeather App Mk2 is a weather forecast application for Android,
            developed using one of OpenWeather’s APIs. The original application
            was developed during my second year of University, for a course
            called Mobile Applications Development, and was my first experience
            coding in Java and for Android. The original brief was to study what
            Android applications already exist and then to create one ourselves.
            I chose to create a weather application because I thought it would
            be a good challenge but not beyond my abilities at the time.
          </p>
          <h2>Mk1</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="image right"
              ><img src="/images/OWM1.jpg" alt="" height="250em"
            /></span>
            The first version of the app uses OpenWeather’s Current Weather API
            to get location based weather data from either a town/city name or
            via GPS coordinates. The application downloads the weather data as a
            JSON file and then inputs the downloaded data into textviews to
            display the information to the user. Users can save locations by
            long-pressing the save button and then access these locations by
            short-pressing the same button. These saved locations are displayed
            as text views on a linear layout, and clicking one will return to
            the main screen and send an API call for said location. The
            background is faily dynamic and consists of two layers, a cloud
            layer and a background colour. In the data retrieved from the API
            call, is a cloud cover percentage value, which is used by the app to
            select one of several premade cloudy backgrounds.
          </p>
          <h2>Mk2</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="image right"
              ><img src="/images/OWM2.jpg" alt="" height="250em"
            /></span>
            The second version of the app uses OpenWeather’s Current Weather and
            One Call API. The One Call API allows for current, hourly, and daily
            forecast data, however, only works via GPS coordinates. To get
            around this, I used the Current Weather API call to get GPS
            coordinates for a given town/city name. Whilst this method works, it
            is not very efficient. The application now uses a drawer activity
            and fragment container system to switch between forecast modes. The
            GPS and SAVE buttons were changed to floating action buttons in
            order to persist through each forecast mode. This new structure
            allows for easier data transfer between forecast modes, as the
            drawer activity holds code needed by all three modes, such as the
            API calls, and each fragment has code specific to its needs. The
            only downgrade from Mk1 to Mk2 has been the design. I was expected
            to enhance the design as well as the functionality of the
            application, and got carried away with the orange and blue
            contrasting theme. The new look is garish and a little offputing,
            and would be the first thing to change if I were to make a Mk3.
          </p>
          <h2>New Code</h2>
          <h3>onNavigationItemSelected() and fragmentManager()</h3>
          <pre>
                                <code>//method to determine which nav option was selected
@Override
public boolean onNavigationItemSelected(@NonNull MenuItem item) {
      switch (item.getItemId()) {
            case R.id.nav_current:
                fragmentManager("Current", currentFragment);
                break;
            case R.id.nav_hourly:
                fragmentManager("Hourly", hourlyFragment);
                break;
            case R.id.nav_daily:
                fragmentManager("Daily", dailyFragment);
                break;
            default:
                taskLoadUp(item.getTitle().toString());
                Toast.makeText(this, item.getTitle(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                break;
      }
 
      drawer.closeDrawer(GravityCompat.START);
      return true;
}
 
//Method to handle fragment switching
@SuppressLint("ResourceType")
public void fragmentManager(String tag, Fragment fragment) {
      FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
 
      fm.findFragmentByTag(tag);
 
      FragmentTransaction ft = fm.beginTransaction();
      ft.setCustomAnimations(R.anim.enter_from_left, R.anim.exit_to_right);
      ft.replace(R.id.fragment_container, fragment, tag);
      ft.commit();
 
      getSupportActionBar().setTitle(tag + " Forecast");
}</code>
                            </pre>
          <p>
            These two methods are used to determine which drawer item was
            selected and then what to do. If one of the three forecast modes are
            selected, then the method fragmentManager() is called, sending two
            parameters: a string “tag” and an instance of each fragment. The
            method then sets up a fragment transaction, and replaces the
            currently held fragment with the given new fragment. If the selected
            drawer item is not a forecast mode, i.e. a saved location, the
            string value of this item is sent to the method taskLoadUp() which
            triggers an API call.
          </p>
          <h3>onPostExecute()</h3>
          <pre>
                                <code>@Override
protected void onPostExecute(String[] xml) {
      setCity(xml[1]);
 
      Fragment fragment = getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.fragment_container);
 
      if (fragment instanceof CurrentFragment)
                currentFragment.unPackJSON(xml[0], xml[1]);
      if (fragment instanceof HourlyFragment)
                hourlyFragment.unPackJSON(xml[0], xml[1]);
      if (fragment instanceof DailyFragment)
                dailyFragment.unPackJSON(xml[0], xml[1]);
}</code>
                            </pre>
          <p>
            This is the final method run by the custom class called
            DownloadWeather, which extends the Async Task class, and runs in the
            background as to not interrupt the UI thread. The method must
            determine which fragment is currently held in the fragment
            container. Due to the differences in each fragment, this method must
            determine which class’ version of the unPackJSON() method to run.
            The parameters send to unPackJSON() are string values stored in the
            array “xml”. These strings store the JSON data and the name of the
            town/city.
          </p>
          <h3>unPackJSON()</h3>

          <p>
            This is the Hourly fragments version of the unPackJSON() method. The
            first thing each method does, is convert the string which holds the
            JSON file into a JSONObject. Once this has been done, the data is
            gathered from specific sections of the JSON file and then added to
            global arrays inside a for loop. Once the loop has completed, a
            method is called which then updates the values within the recycler
            view.

          <h2>Improvements for Mk3</h2>
          <p>
            If there were to be a third version of this application, it would
            have to solve a number of issues present in Mk2. First and foremost
            would be the design, a transition away from the harsh contrast of
            blue and orange, potentially back to the more basic look of Mk1.
            Secondly, the API calls would have to be simplified, as having to
            call from two separate APIs just for app functionality is
            inefficient. Lastly, unifying similar code elements, such as the
            unPackJSON() methods, would also increase efficiency. Less important
            improvements might include changing the cloudy background images to
            be non-static, i.e. a procedural animated background.
